# Crash JavaScript

A collection of JavaScript utility functions.

This library is being used by most of
Human Instrumentality Project (HIP)
JavaScript programs.

## Installation

The library in this source repo
can be installed from source using GNU Make.

```bash
make \
  install
```

The library is officially published on the
the uncensorable
[Ur](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/ur)
user repository and application store as
`libcrash-js`.
The source code is published on the
[Ethereum Virtual Machine File System](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/evmfs)
so it can't possibly be taken down.

To install it from there just type

```bash
ur \
  libcrash-js
```

A censorable HTTP Github mirror of the recipe published there
is hosted on
[libcrash-bash-ur](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/libcrash-js-ur).
Be aware it could go offline any time.
