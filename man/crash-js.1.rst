JavaScript library providing useful functions
to write easy to read, easy to extend

Most The Martian Company's JavaScript applications

Significant applications developed using the library are
the Ethereum Virtual Machine File System (EVMFS) [1]_,
the Ur [2]_ uncensorable Life and DogeOS user repository
and application store, its reference
pub [3]_ publishing tool and source retrieval tool aspe [4]_,
EVM OpenPGP Key Server [5]_, the uncensorable, undeletable,
distributed, network-neutral, decentralized Twitter
(whose sources are entirely hosted on
the EVMFS) and many others currently in development.

Crash JavaScript is a core component of the
Human Instrumentality Project (HIP).
